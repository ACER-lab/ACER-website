Our research focusses on the role of the cerebellum in emotion and motivation in health and disease. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques are used in our group to transiently manipulate neural excitability and to explore potential clinical applications in the treatment of disorders of emotion.

My research interests focus on the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie socio-emotional behavior. By using behavioral experiments, hormone administration, neuroimaging, brain-stimulation and lesion studies, I aim to unravel the psycho-neuro-endocrinological underpinnings of socio-emotional behavior in healthy as well as clinical samples. That is, any socio-emotional behavior, ranging from basic fear and reward processing to aggression, morality, neuro-economics and beyond.

After my PhD at Leipzig University and postdoctoral positions at Radboud University Nijmegen and the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, I joined the lab as a postdoctoral researcher in 2019. While I had close to no knowledge on the cerebellum prior to starting work in the group, it didn’t take long until I was sold on its versatile role in affective and cognitive functions. Now I am primarily involved in unravelling its contributions to negative emotional, particularly aggressive, behaviour. However, I also frequently try to combine this topic with language processing, my original research focus. Within the group I keep myself busy by co-supervising our three PhD candidates, digging into structural MRI data, getting 75% excited and 25% critical about brain stimulation, and convincing people to analyse their data with linear mixed models.

    <p> How does the cerebellum fit in the fronto-limbic network involved in emotion regulation? My research aims to assess the role of the cerebellum in reactive aggression with (f)MRI. In healthy volunteers, I study structural and functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the fronto-limbic circuit involved in aggression, as well as volumetric cerebellar correlates of aggressive behavior. In collaboration with the Central Military Hospital, we compare functional connectivity between veterans with and without aggressive behavior. </p>

  My research focuses on the role of the cerebellum in aggression and aggression-related functions. In one of my studies, healthy participants receive tDCS to the cerebellum while engaging in an aggression-evoking task, the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm. Furthermore, I am working on a meta-analysis to investigate cerebellar functional activation patterns of monetary reward anticipation and monetary reward outcome processing in healthy adults.

My name is Fleur, and I am (for now!) the latest addition to the ACER lab. After doing a final Master’s research project on the effects of cerebellar brain stimulation on language processing with Jana and Dennis in 2021, I stuck around to pursue a PhD in this very same lab. Like Jana, I have a personal interest in language processing. In a very general sense, however, I am interested in finding out more about how our experiences shape our interpretations of and our (emotional) responses to the world around us. The work that we do in this lab allows me to play a role in uncovering (a small) part of that puzzle, which is ultimately what motivated me to pursue this PhD. I am currently working on a project in which we will use cerebellar tDCS and eye tracking to further investigate the role of the cerebellum in aggression and anxiety in a social dominance task. Future work will likely include the application of cerebellar TMS in clinical populations, so stay tuned!  <br>
Finally a few fun facts about me: I have about 75 house plants, each has their own name; I have a small (and by small I mean tiny, I don’t have room for much more with all these plants) ‘pop culture Hot Wheels’ collection, which includes the Beatles’ yellow submarine, the flying car from the Jetsons, Cruella de Vil’s car and several Batmobiles; I love reading and have a reputation amongst friends for buying new books despite never having had the time to read the ones I had bought on a previous shopping spree (some might call it a book addiction).

At the <a href="https://www.braic.nl">Brain Research and Innovation Centre</a>, I investigate the effects of brain stimulation on anxiety and aggression-related complaints in military personnel. A mild, non-invasive form of brain stimulation is used: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).
I am currently involved in two brain stimulation projects. One project focuses on military personnel who receive treatment for mental complaints. The second project focuses on military personnel without psychological complaints, in which self-control during threat is investigated.

My PhD project studies the effects of cerebellar anodal tDCS on cognitive function in patients with the Cerebellar Cognitive and Affective Syndrome (CCAS). This clinical trial is conducted at the Radboudumc and patients from all across the country are included. We investigate the effects of a 2-week tDCS intervention on cognition, focussing on attention and executive functions. We will also try to explore the dynamics of a possible treatment effect and patient or disease characteristics which might influence the effectiveness of tDCS.<br>
